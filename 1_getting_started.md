# 1 Before We Start...

## Do you have python3.7 installed?

## Do you have git installed?

##Do you have PyCharm community edition installed?
* Another editor will do if you are more comfortable with that. 
* If you are starting from scratch PyCharm is a recommended option.

I suggested holding a **"Python Object Oriented Programming
Seminar"**, but the acronym was unpopular, though potentially quite accurate...

# 2 A Little History...

Python’s origins lie way back in distant December 1989, 
making it nearly the same age as Taylor Swift , Simpsons or Game Boy. :)

Created by **Guido van Rossum** a Dutch computer scientist. AKA The BDFL
(the Python community’s **Benevolent Dictator for Life**)

Last year Guido stepped down from this role. 
We are yet to see the impact that has departure makes on the language. Over the years he has proved himself 
an excellent community leader and language designer.

Python also served a central role in van Rossum’s **Computer Programming for Everybody** initiative. 
The CP4E’s goal was to make programming more accessible to the ‘layman’ and encourage a basic level of coding literacy as an equal essential knowledge alongside English literacy and math skills.

Python 2 the first open source version available on sourceforge was introduced in 2000
As the release notes stated, ‘the most important change in Python 2.0 may not be to the code at all, but to how Python is developed’.
 
Paul Graham - Y Combinator, hacker news . Wrote The Python Paradox 2004. 

A large number of 'unicorns' have used python , youtube, google, airbnb, instagram, dropbox.

Django - set a high standard for how a open-source project should be conducted. extensive docs help for new users.

2008 python 3 appeared. The 3 version was a full overhaul with many backwards incompatible features.
Python 3 release created some controversy and adoption has been very slow. Only in the last 2 years or so the balance has switched to 3 being the default.


# Characteristics of the Language 
* Slow
* Though optimised options to exist. (Rewrite portions of code in C++, Cython)
* Open Source. Evolution through PEP's 
* Focus on your solution to a problem and not the requirements of the interpreter
* Dynamic
* Loose typing - assignment by reference 
* Readability (leads to maintainability)
* High level / Declarative style 
* Productivity
* Fun
* Mixed functional and object orientated style

# 'Pythonic' thinking
* import this Easter egg. The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters 1999
* Significant whitespace
* "A language between consenting adults" - Raymond Hettinger. 
* There are no locks on the doors in terms of 'public' and 'private'. Agreed conventions instead.
* Strong helpful community and ecosystem. 
Recently making big efforts to redress the lack of BAME and non-male coders.   
* Strong presence in web and data science


* flask
* django, wagtail, geodjango
* ipython
* jupyter notebook
* requests
* numpy
* pandas
* boto3
* pillow / PIL
* sqlite3

1000's Talks on youtube , anything by **Raymond Hettinger** is recommended
